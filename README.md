# The VBA of Wall Street

# Background:
This demo uses VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. \

The VBA script loops through all the stocks in teh dataset for one year and outputs the following information:
  -The ticker symbol
  -The yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -The total stock volume of the stock


The script also conditionally formats to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The script returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

The script runs on every worksheet, i.e., every year.
